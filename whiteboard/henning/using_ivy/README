Copy all files in this directory into the "build" directory of the
Velocity tree to use the ivy dependency resolver
(http://www.jayasoft.org/ivy/) instead of our self-rolled ibiblio
download. Make sure that the ivy jar ends up in build/lib

ivy features a local file cache (just like maven), dependency checking
and resolving and a lot more stuff. It also has an Apache friendly
license.
