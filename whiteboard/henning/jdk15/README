This is an Uberspect Implementation (with test) that only compiles under JDK 1.5
but allows Objects that implement Iterable to be used in #foreach()

Use it by adding the following line to your velocity.properties:

runtime.introspector.uberspect = org.apache.velocity.util.introspection.JDK15UberspectImpl
