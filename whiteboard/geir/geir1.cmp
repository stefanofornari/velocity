SetBangStart() : called with val = 4
SetBangStart() : called with val = 5
This tests the pass by name some more, seeing if
we can assign to a complete reference that
we pass in (bangstartII) or, for the truly insane
pass in a reference that a property is assumed
within (BangstartII)

Note that you wont see anything rendered, but
SetBangStart will output to stdout
