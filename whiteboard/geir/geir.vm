Tests the basic arg passing for VMs
We want to pass through two VMs

#macro( foo $a )
  Hello from foo!
  #foreach($i in $a)
    foo: $i
  #end
#end

#macro( floog $a)
  floog : $a
#end

#set($woogie = "geir")
#set($x = 4)
#set($y = 10)
#bar("hello $woogie")
#bar( $woogie )
#bar( 1 )
#bar( true )
#foo( ["a","b"] )
#foo( [1..4] )
#foo( [$x..$y] )

This tests the pass-by-name feature

#macro( bar $b )
  bar : $b
  #floog( $b )
#end

>$provider.bang()<
#bar( $provider.bang() )
#bar( $provider.bang() )
